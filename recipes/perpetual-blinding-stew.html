        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A <strong>perpetual 1-day blinding stew</strong>, also known as 
            <strong>forever-blind-for-a-day soup</strong>, <strong>hunter's pot o' blindness</strong>,
            or <strong>hunter's sightless stew</strong>, is a pot into which blindness-inducing 
            foodstuffs are placed and cooked. The pot is never or rarely emptied all the way, and
            ingredients and liquid are replenished as necessary. It is differentiated from a
            <a>perpetual stew</a> by the fact that eating it causes the eater to become blind for a day.
            Such foods can continue cooking for decades or longer if properly maintained. The concept
            is often a common element of medieval inns, where it was <em>often necessary to render unruly
            guests blind</em>.</p>
